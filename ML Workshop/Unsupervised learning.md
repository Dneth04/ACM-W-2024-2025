# Unsupervised Machine Learning with Python workshop
The workshop introduces learners to unsupervised machine learning and cover 4 different tasks under this. It covers the implementation and the preprocessing required for each algorithm. <br>
The python libraries used include: 
* **Data Handling:**  `numpy`, `pandas`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Machine Learning**: `sklearn`, `mlxtend` (various models and metrics)

## 1. Dimensionality Reduction
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

## 2. Clustering
* K-Means Clustering
* Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)
* Agglomerative Clustering

## 3. Anomaly Detection
* Isolation Forest
* Local Outlier Factor

## 4. Association Rule Mining
* Apriori algorithm
