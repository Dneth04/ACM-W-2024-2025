### **Diamond Price Prediction with Classifiers and Regressors**

This notebook focuses on predicting diamond prices using machine learning techniques, covering both regression and classification approaches.

### **Step 1: Set Up and Import Libraries**

The following libraries are imported to support data processing, visualization, and machine learning:

* **Data Handling**: `numpy`, `pandas`  
* **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
* **Machine Learning**: `sklearn` (various models and metrics)

---

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

* **Dataset**: The `gemstone.csv` file is used as the dataset.  
* **Steps**:  
  1. **Dropping Missing Values**: Ensures no null entries.  
  2. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: The `id` column is dropped.  
  3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converts `cut`, `color`, and `clarity` into numeric codes.

---

### **Step 3: Data Visualization**

* **Correlation Heatmap**:  
  * A heatmap is plotted to visualize feature correlations.  
  * Helps in understanding relationships between features and identifying multicollinearity.

### **Step 5: Regression Models (Predicting Diamond Prices)**

Features include `carat`, `cut`, `color`, `clarity`, `depth`, `table`, `x`, `y`, and `z`. The target variable is `price`.

#### **Models Used:**

1. **Linear Regression**:  
   * Captures linear relationships.  
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**:  
   * Handles non-linear relationships using tree splitting.  
3. **Random Forest Regressor**:  
   * An ensemble method combining multiple decision trees.  
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**:  
   * Sequentially improves by correcting previous errors.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**

* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures average error.  
* **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Penalizes larger errors.  
* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Provides errors in target units.  
* **R² Score**: Indicates the model's ability to explain variance.

---

### **Step 6: Scatter Plot**

* Visualizes actual vs predicted prices for `Random Forest` and `Gradient Boosting` models.

---

### **Step 8: Classification Models (Predicting Price Ranges)**

#### **Price Range Classification:**

* **Price ranges** are defined with bins: `[0, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000]`, labeled as `Low`, `Medium`, `High`, and `Very High`.

#### **Classification Models:**

1. **Logistic Regression**:  
   * Predicts price range probabilities.  
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**:  
   * Creates a tree-based classification model.  
3. **Random Forest Classifier**:  
   * Combines multiple trees for better accuracy.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**

* **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.  
* **Confusion Matrix**: True vs predicted class counts.  
* **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

### **Data Visualizations**

* Confusion matrices are plotted for each classification model.  
* Scatter plots for regression predictions allow visual comparison of model performance.

---

### **Session takeaways**

* Regression models predict exact prices with metrics like RMSE and R², while classification models categorize diamonds into price ranges.  
* Visualization aids in interpreting model effectiveness and results.
